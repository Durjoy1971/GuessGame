## Introduction
This is a web-based Hangman game where players guess the letters of a hidden word. The game provides hints and tracks incorrect guesses. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or reaches the maximum number of incorrect guesses.

## Features
- **Random word selection with hints**: The game selects a random word from a pre-defined list and provides a hint for the player.
- **Interactive on-screen keyboard**: Players can click letters on the screen to make guesses.
- **Hangman image updates with incorrect guesses**: The hangman figure progressively appears as incorrect guesses are made.
- **Modal for game over and victory messages**: A pop-up modal informs the player of a win or loss at the end of the game.
- **Responsive design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
